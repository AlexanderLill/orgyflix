# orgyflix

Orgyflix is a soial platform in which people can watch their favorite TV Shows and movies together, by scheduling events and letting other people and friends join them. People can search for nearby events and filter them by vicinity, time of the day, content and participants.

This project was created in a 2-man team during a 3-day workshop using the MEAN stack.
The visible result is a prototype of a server-side application written in node.js and express.js, using a MongoDB database; the client-side application (which can be found in frontend) was developed using Angular 2.
